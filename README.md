Paper partial reconstruction: "Mixed integer programming for multi-vehicle path planning" by Schouwenaars et al.

The paper can be found here:   
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7076321

The sub-topics that I have implemented so far:
- Fuel-optimal path with fixed-arrival time  
- Receding Horizon  
- Fuel-optimal and shortest-time path

The results somehow are not identical with the paper. These might be because lack of technical details on the paper or misconception on my side.
